# Analyzing Stock Prices

## Overview of Project
Our client asked us to provide an automated way to analyze and provide summary statistics for stock prices in 2018.  I created a macro that provided a summary table of the handful of stocks; however, the client's concern is that the created macro will not perform well when applied to a very large data set.

**The goal of this project is to refactor the existing VBA code to determine if it will improve performance, and to then explain why.**

## Results
By refactoring the code, I was able to improve the total processing time by 50%.
